# The file travels in every bundle (`resources` in crates/satz-studio/Dioxus.toml), which
# is what MIT and Apache 2.0 ask of a binary redistribution. `about.toml` holds the
# allow-list of licences and `about.hbs` the layout; a dependency under a licence the
# allow-list does not name fails here, naming the crate.
#
# The `core` job of .github/workflows/ci.yml runs `--check` on every pull request and
# every push to main, after `cargo fetch --locked` has unpacked the crate sources of
# all three targets.
